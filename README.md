# Dotdev

This is the source code for my website available at https://matsjla.no. It is
split into the following components:

- @dotdev/frontend: Frontend & user-facing Next.js application
- @dotdev/spotify: AWS Lambda code for fetching Spotify player activity

The infrastructure is ran on AWS & Vercel, managed by Terraform in a private
repository.
